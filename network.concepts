Transient connection issues, also known as transient faults, are temporary problems that occur when trying to connect to a service or resource. These issues are usually short-lived and often resolve themselves without any intervention. Here are some common causes:

Momentary loss of network connectivity: This can happen due to brief network interruptions.
Temporary unavailability of a service: Sometimes, a service might be temporarily down or busy.
Throttling: Services may limit the number of connections or requests to manage load and maintain performance.
Resource reconfiguration: In cloud environments, resources might be reallocated or reconfigured, causing brief connection issues12.
To handle these issues, it's recommended to implement retry logic in your applications. This means that if a connection attempt fails, the application should wait for a short period and then try again
